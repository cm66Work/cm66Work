# â˜• Hi, I'm Connor ðŸ‘‹

I am an indie game developer, who loves to design and build simple games or tools for my many unity projects!

I am currently taking a deep dive into custom editor tool development within Unity.

Taking what I learnt from my Coffee Bean demo project I have now started working on a small indie game centered around Lofi and coffee brewing.

<p> Momentum Rush is a Cyberpunk themed endless runner mobile game created within the Unity game engine
The project was created as a learning experience for me, as I have never published a full mobile game before. </p>

<p>
Coffee Bean is a small tech demo where you play as a Barista running a coffee shop, whose job it is to take orders and make coffee for customers!
The game was inspired by my time working in a coffee shop after Uni.
